# Require users to manually advance the timer to "break mode"

## Context and Problem Statement

When a pomo is completed, should the timer automatically advance to a break or should the user manually advance the timer?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Reducing cognitive overload
* Flexibility

## Considered Options

* Advance the timer automatically
* Require the user to click a button before advancing

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option "Require the user to click a button before advancing" because:

* The user may be in the middle of a very small task (finishing writing a sentence), and will need just a few seconds to finish
* Requiring the user to interact with the app ensures that they do not completely ignore the app, and by extend the Pomodoro philosophy
