# Pomo Progress Tracker
 
## Context and Problem Statement

A core feature of the app is to offer the user a longer break after their 4th successive pomo, but there lacks a mean of presenting that information to the user. What's the best way to present that information in a nondistracting way?

## Considered Options

* Show nothing to minimize distraction
* Show a counter somewhere on the screen
* Show a set of "bubbles" that fill up with each successive pomo

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "bubbles", because
* A clear yet minimal way of conveying which pomo cycle the user is currently on. 

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* The user can now keep track of how many cycles they've completed towards a long break without being cluttered with more numbers on the screen
