# Task List

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to implement the task part of the pomodoro technique without a feature explosion or cluttering the interface too much, how can we do that?

## Considered Options

* Heavily integrated task list that binds to a "done" button after completed pomos
* A simplified task list that the user manually adds and removes tasks from
* No task list
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option "A simplified task list" because:

* Ease of implementation
* More user interaction that forces intent on the pomodoro process
* More automation can lead to less focus on the process itself.
