# Have the app scream at users

## Context and Problem Statement

We offer the user some flexibility in deciding when a break starts. However, there is a risk that they will forget that they are supposed to take a break. How do we make sure the user isn't overworking themself?

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* No mercy

## Considered Options

* Do nothing and allow the user to return to the app when ready to take a break
* Re-sound the standard notification sound at a regular interval
* Scream at the user at max volume

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option "Scream at the user at max volume" because:

* They deserve it
* They are likely stressed out, which is against the Pomodoro philosophy, and such behavior must be punished
