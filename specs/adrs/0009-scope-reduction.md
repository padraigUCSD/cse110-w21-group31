## Context and Problem Statement

[Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question.]

Should we kill the task tracker feature? This means we would stop work on E2S8, E2S9, and E2T2 and.

* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].

Change order:
toggle labels (for sure)
that we will completely kill the tasktracker feature
Thus, Kill:
- e2s8
- e2s9
- e2t2




doucment why we chose our arch (biz reason: modularity/oop lets us integrate many ancillary features around a state-based core. this is similar to how ADT works in EHR software, the core of many ERP system etc)
