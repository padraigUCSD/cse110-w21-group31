### **About Carbon**
Carbon is IBM’s open-source design system for products and digital experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation, the system consists of working code, design tools and resources, and human interface guidelines. As IBM’s official design system, Carbon serves a wide range of designers and developers building digital products and experiences. Carbon is funded and built by IBM. 
The goals of the design system include improving UI consistency and quality, making the design and development process more efficient and focused, establishing a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and providing clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.
The design system is built React first. We also support core parts of the system in vanilla JS, Angular, Vue, and Svelte. If you’re using a different framework, you can still build components by following our guidelines for other frameworks.
 
### **Guiding principles of Carbon**
Carbon is open. The design system is a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open source movement. Carbon’s users are also its makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.
Carbon is inclusive. It’s designed and built to be accessible to all, regardless of ability or situation.
Carbon is modular and flexible. The system’s modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. Its components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.
Carbon puts the user first. Using rigorous research into users’ needs and desires, Carbon is laser-focused on real people.
Carbon builds consistency. Based on the IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.






 
## 3. Business Processes
The parties agree that the business processes defined below are to be operationalized. These business processes do not represent the entirety of the team’s business processes as several processes are explicitly defined or will be explicitly defined in the future by Professor Powell. If a business process defined here comes into conflict with an officially sanctioned “best practice” process defined by CSE 110 teaching staff, then that business process will prevail and be operationalized unless a majority of team members object to the change.
Meetings
The parties agree upon the following means of scheduling and conducting meetings of the following types:
### 3.1 Daily Standup Meetings
The parties agree that:

Operations & Administrative

### 3.6 Knowledge Management
The parties agree to operationalize the following business process:
Knowledge Management is the process of documenting and managing business processes, IT systems, and technical know-how. Our Capabilities Lead provides or directs knowledge management services in the form of documenting business processes and maintaining documentation & training manuals for the software and systems we develop. We take care to ensure that all of our business processes and work activities are well-documented through documents like this team working agreement, project plans, daily standup notes, and so forth.

### 3.7 DocuSign Workflow
The parties agree to operationalize the following business process:
DocuSign is our team’s eSignature solution. Whenever a project lead of UPR requests a binding signature on a document from you, it is our expectation that it will be completed within the DocuSign workflow.

DocuSign Workflow

1. Send
A DocuSign request for a given document will be sent to you from an authorized email address. Currently, authorized origin email addresses include and are limited to: padraig.macgabann@nakamurapartners.com and padraig.macgabann@gmail.com. 

DocuSign requests from other email addresses may not be legitimate and should be reported to your Capabilities Lead.

2. Sign
Follow instructions as originated in DocuSign to complete the signature.

3. Return
Complete the workflow that DocuSign dictates in (2), which returns the signed document to us.


Note that sometimes, you may be asked to fill out an otherwise completed form without
signing it and submit it to a project lead or a service desk, where it will then be processed and then
sent to you as in (1) to be signed in this process.
 
Human Resources & Performance Management

### 3.8 Performance Improvement
The parties agree to operationalize and adhere to the following process for performance improvement:
Both project leads are accountable to the team for punctuality, communications, and process reliability. Every week, all team members fill out a weekly performance survey scorecard (demonstrated in the figure below) and some comments so project leads can improve their operations. The purpose and benefit of doing this is that this process helps makes a positive team member experience a priority and helps the project leads continuously improve operations and stay accountable.


The weekly performance improvement survey can be accessed at the link below:
https://www.nakamurapartners.com/mck-survey

### 3.9 Conflict Resolution
The parties agree to operationalize and adhere to the following process for conflict resolution:
The Parties agree to attempt initially to solve all claims, disputes or controversies arising under, out of or in connection with this Agreement by conducting good faith negotiations. If the Parties are unable to settle the matter between themselves, the matter shall thereafter be resolved by alternative dispute resolution, starting with mediation conducted by one or both team leaders provided that the leader(s) conducting the mediation is not accessory to the respective claim, dispute, or controversy, and including, if necessary, a final and binding arbitration. 
Whenever a Party shall decide to institute arbitration proceedings, it shall give written notice to that effect to the other Party. The Party giving such notice shall refrain from instituting the arbitration proceedings for a period of three (3) days following such notice. During such period, the Parties shall make good faith efforts to amicably resolve the dispute without arbitration. For the purposes of this agreement, arbitration is not conducted in the legal sense and as such, any arbitration hereunder shall be conducted under the rules of arbitration or mediation for CSE 110 project teams instituted by the team mentor, TA Chad Hayen, or the course professor, Prof. Thomas Powell. 

Each such arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator: the team’s mentor Chad Hayen. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant specific performance. 
### 3.10 Prevention and Resolution of Harassment and Discrimination
Harassment and/or discrimination of any team member will not be tolerated. The parties agree to operationalize and adhere to the following policy regarding the prevention and resolution of harassment and discrimination:
TEAM MEMBER RESPONSIBILITY 
All members of the team share responsibility for creating and maintaining a learning and working environment free from discrimination and harassment. This means not engaging in, allowing, or condoning behavior contrary to the policy. 

PROJECT LEAD RESPONSIBILITY 
Project leads bear the primary responsibility for maintaining an environment free from discrimination and harassment and to act promptly and stop it whenever they become aware of it, whether or not a complaint has been made. They are responsible for creating and maintaining a positive and productive learning and working environment, leading by example, and identifying and addressing issues in a timely and fair manner. This involves, if appropriate for the circumstances, taking prompt disciplinary action(s) and providing written documentation or corroborative evidence of steps taken to deal with the situation and put a stop to it.

HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT PROCEDURES 
1. Ask the Person to Stop Immediately 
Depending on the situation, there are issues that can be resolved by communicating with the person directly as they may be unaware of the impact of their behaviors and may change their behavior once they are made aware of the issue. Let them know that their behavior is unwelcome, offensive, embarrassing, humiliating, or demeaning and that it must stop immediately. This direct resolution could be in the form of a direct verbal or written request. 

2. Tell a Project Lead 
If addressing the person directly is not possible, or is inappropriate, the issue should be brought to the attention of one or both of the respondent’s project lead by you directly.
3. Tell a TA or Professor
If the lead’s intervention does not resolve the situation, or if the complaint is directed against one or both of the project leads, you should contact the appropriate TA (Chad Hayen) or Professor (Prof. Thomas Powell) for help and advice on how to resolve the issue.
