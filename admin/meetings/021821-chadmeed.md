Check in with chad:
-People are tired, but otherwise good
-Went over standups - async - blockers - need to transfer from slack to repo
-Went over division of work - theoretical breakdown
-Talked about in discussion - sometimes implementation of various elements spilled over into other categories - could have used clearer timeline
-E.g. long skip logic spilling over into timer logic

Specific questions:
-How do you feel about the roadmap? Scale back? On Target?
-Still figuring out some of what to do in sprint 3, particularly task tracker
-Had to adjust how tasks were allocated, doing it again in the future?
-Want to avoid bottlenecks
-Could assign tickets to groups of people
-May be better in the future now that a foundational timer logic and controller is in place

Grading:
-Adherence to process
	- meetings
	- standups
	- testing/docs
-Code should be easy to understand - could we onboard someone quickly?

-Mentor meetings a good opportunity to have someone to talk to, less something to be anxious/worried about

In a good spot, figuring out what works for team/schedules, hitting stride :)

Group meeting:
-Sprint retro - async? Hard to do right away as much of testing is yet to be done
