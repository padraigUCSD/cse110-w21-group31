## Note Bucket section 

### Items that we're disappointed about: (anonymous adding)
- Kinda sad that we had to kill off the task list, would have been useful lol
- I feel like I could have done more this past sprint.
- ^^
- The earliest part of the sprint probably could’ve been utilized better to get stuff done.
- I wish I could have been more present and not too weighed down by other school work
- I wish I have more time to polish the app better
- A bit disappointed that we didn’t have time to give the app more visual polish (+1)
- Wish i could have been more available, i think i could have been more organized as i stressed out the team needlessly.
- I wish I could have assigned cards more effectively, its been a bit of a struggle both sprints.
### Items that we're glad about: (anonymous adding)
- CD and deploy previews are awesome for review
- Working with team to explore new thing
- I’m happy that our platform has all of the basic functionalities working! I also think that our website looks pretty clean
- Coverage has been consistently high
- The team is really getting the hang of our architecture and code quality is very good
- The team is awesome at coming together and getting the job done if the chips are down
- I feel like we really support each other
- Glad to actually have finished all the functionality! I always feel like there’s more things sneaking up that I forgot or something
- Personally, I think communication really improved this sprint; was able to meet more with subteams and figure out what needed to be done
- The app looks like an actual webapp instead of unformatted HTML hell

### Discussion notes (Talk about the topics as a team)
- Personal Availability
  - bigger teams do make work more segmented
  - Carries schedule issues, the way the school is structured is much different than actual work
  - There was a period where the team felt pretty lost and personally was being hit by work. The responsibility should lie in the management who should be providing the clarifications to avoid that situation. At the end of the day though as long as we’re moving forward towards our goals as a team. 
  - Team sizes are too large, increases bus factor  
- Sprint outline/planning + management
  - Woops - we defined sprint goals but didn’t clearly outline how to achieve them, causing confusion for the first half of the sprint
  - But the project is still delivered on schedule tho
  - Yung money ship still afloatt 
  - AutoPomo cards were totally awful sorry. - p
  - Bleedover of test tickets from sprint 1 to 2 was confusing
- Good functionality and clean code base
  - Good test cover and very concise
  - Looks like something you’d see on a “real” website
  - Functionality is perfect for the task
  - Runs great looks great :)
- Improved team cohesion and synergy 
  - making sure the young money ship is never sinking
  - Our team doesn't seem to have any clashing, turf wars, or petty politics, “one of the best small team experiences i have had in my college career.” 
  - Any unease is not within the team, but is collectively directed toward the client in an act of unity
  - Seems like people don't have too big of an ego
  - Meeting with people is really helpful for me. -s
  - Some people on other teams are not even responding any more. Leads not assigning themselves any work Some teams have total carrying of the project by a few people, and have total management failure.  -c, david.
  - @chad we are proudly unexceptional. --team 31
