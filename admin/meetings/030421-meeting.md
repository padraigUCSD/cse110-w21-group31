## Actual Notes
Actual Notes taken during the meeting may optionally be written into this digital document below:  
- Discussion was suprisingly helpful, was able to gather feedback from other groups as well as see how they handled certain issues
  - Feedback include: Many complements on the minimalistic approach and aesthetic, different ideas on how to implement a "help"/"instructions" sections, praise for accessibility concerns.
- Chad meeting:
  - Went pretty well, we're on our way to achieve all our planned features (since we culled so many needless ones)
  - Ready to wrap things up cleanly
  - Unfortunately grades are a toss-up and kind of in the air
  - Luckily it seems that we're not on either of the extremes 
- Last "sprint" of this Sprint
  - Review + Retrospective this weekend, look out for a When2Meet
  - Similar handling to last time, although now we have a more well rounded image
  - Items still to be accomplished: Breakpoints, final tests
  - Keep up with Standup notes please!
